#CreateDeleteUser 

*First method generates the RSA keypair and returns it
*Second method accepts the paramether of the user name and takes the public/private key of the generated keyair and then creates a file and saves that public/private key to that xml file.
*Last method checks if the public or private file of corresponding user is created and deletes it with the command of the user.
